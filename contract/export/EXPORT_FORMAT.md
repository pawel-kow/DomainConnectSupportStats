# Domain Connect support statistics: the static export format

This file describes the data set that `export.py` writes. It is written for the developer
of a frontend (a static statistics site) and is meant to be enough on its own: with this
file and one export directory you can build every page. The JSON Schemas in
[`docs/schemas/export/`](schemas/export/) are the machine-readable contract and say the
same thing in a form a validator can check. A complete example export of a small simulated
database is in [`docs/examples/export/`](examples/export/).

## Purpose and audience

The data set describes how far [Domain Connect](https://www.domainconnect.org/) is
supported across the DNS providers that host real domains. A TLD zone file (for example
`.com`) is scanned for domains that publish a Domain Connect record. The DNS providers
behind those records are identified, and each is probed for every published Domain Connect
template. The export combines both:

- **who supports what, now**: per DNS provider, per stack of DNS providers, per service
  provider and per template, which templates are supported;
- **how much it matters**: how many of the scanned domains are hosted by a DNS provider,
  and therefore how many domains a template can reach;
- **how it changes**: series over the scans (imports) and over the support sweeps.

It holds no per-domain data, and nothing about individual scans beyond the totals listed
below.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Domain Connect | An open protocol that lets a service (e.g. a website builder or mail host) configure a customer's DNS at the customer's DNS provider in one click, by applying a *template*. A domain advertises support through a `_domainconnect` TXT record that holds the URL of its DNS provider's Domain Connect endpoint. |
| DNS provider | One Domain Connect deployment: one endpoint (API URL) that answered the protocol's settings request. Keyed by `dns_provider_id`, a number. Two deployments of the same software (e.g. two hosting companies running Plesk) are two DNS providers. Sometimes called a deployment. |
| Stack | All DNS providers that declare the same `providerId` in their settings response, i.e. deployments of the same provider software or company. Keyed by `provider_id`, a string such as `plesk.com`. A DNS provider that declares no `providerId` belongs to no stack. |
| Service provider | A publisher of templates in the [Domain Connect Templates repository](https://github.com/Domain-Connect/Templates). Keyed by `service_provider_id`, a string, usually a domain name. |
| Template | One service of a service provider (one file in the Templates repository): a set of DNS records the DNS provider applies. Keyed by the pair (`service_provider_id`, `service_id`). |
| Template version | A template's `version` number. The export folds versions together: a template is supported by a DNS provider when any stored version is. Columns named `versions` list the version numbers involved. |
| Import, scan | One scan of one or more zone files. Keyed by `import_id`, a number (normally the scan's start time as Unix seconds, but not guaranteed). A scan may be *probe-sampled*: only a random percentage of the zone's domains is scanned, so "% of scanned domains" is a share of the sample, which estimates, but is not, a share of the whole zone. |
| Scanned domains | The domains an import actually queried (`scanned_domains`), the denominator of every domain percentage. |
| Support sweep | One run of the support probes: every DNS provider is asked about every template version. Keyed by `sweep_id`, a number increasing with time. Smaller runs exist too (one provider only, one template only, or only recently changed templates); the history tables say which runs they count. |
| Supported | The DNS provider's latest probe for a template version answered that it supports it (HTTP 200). |
| Not supported | The latest probe answered that it does not (HTTP 404). |
| Not yet determined | Neither: never probed yet, still being retried, or failed. The export does not break this down (see [Redaction](#redaction)); it is `total - supported_count - unsupported_count`. |
| Error | A DNS provider whose last settings request or support probe failed carries an error status and message (`settings_status`, `support_status`, `settings_last_error`, `support_last_error`). |
| Domain share | How many of an import's scanned domains point to a DNS provider (or stack) through their Domain Connect record (`domains`), and that as a percentage of the scanned domains. |
| Reach | For a template or service provider: the scanned domains hosted by the DNS providers that support it, each DNS provider counted once. It is how many of the scanned domains could apply the template today. |
| Domain-share import | The one import that every domain and reach column of an export describes (see [Domain-share import](#domain-share-import)). |
| Release | One complete export: a directory of files written together from one consistent view of the database. |

## Directory layout

```
DIR/
  current -> releases/20261001T000000Z      symlink to the newest release
  releases/
    20261001T000000Z/                       one release, named after its generated_at
      manifest.json
      overview.json
      dns-providers.json
      dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json
      stacks.json
      stacks/{provider_id}.json
      service-providers.json
      service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json
      templates.json
      templates/{service_provider_id}/{service_id}.json
```

- Serve or copy `current/`. `current` is replaced atomically once a new release is
  complete, so it always points at a whole release. A few older releases are kept next to
  it.
- **One release is one consistent snapshot.** All its files were read from the database
  in one transaction, so the lists and cards agree with each other. Never mix files from
  two releases: every file carries its release's `generated_at`, which a reader can
  compare with the manifest's.
- A release directory's name is its `generated_at` without separators. If two exports run
  in the same second, the second gets a `.1` suffix. Don't parse the name; read
  `generated_at`.

File kinds, as keyed in the manifest's `files`:

| Kind | Path template | Report | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overview` | `overview.json` | `support-overview` | Ecosystem-wide series: adoption per import, support per sweep |
| `dns_providers` | `dns-providers.json` | `dns-providers` | List of every DNS provider |
| `dns_provider` | `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` | `dns-provider-summary` | One DNS provider's card |
| `stacks` | `stacks.json` | `stacks` | List of every stack |
| `stack` | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` | `stack-summary` | One stack's card |
| `service_providers` | `service-providers.json` | `service-providers` | List of every service provider |
| `service_provider` | `service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json` | `service-provider-summary` | One service provider's card |
| `templates` | `templates.json` | `service-templates` | List of every template |
| `template` | `templates/{service_provider_id}/{service_id}.json` | `template-summary` | One template's card |

The report name is the `report.py` subcommand that produces the same data; you don't need
it to read the files.

## Reading order

1. Fetch `manifest.json` from the release (`current/manifest.json`).
2. Build each file's URL from the kind's `path` in `manifest.files`: replace each
   `{placeholder}` with the [encoded](#id-encoding) id.
3. Fetch the list or card file.

Don't hard-code the paths from the table above: the manifest's `path` is authoritative.

## `manifest.json`

The release's index, written last. One JSON object on one line.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `format_version` | integer | Version of this format, currently `1`. See [Versioning](#versioning-and-compatibility). |
| `generated_at` | string | When the export ran, UTC, to the second, as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` (e.g. `2026-10-01T00:00:00Z`). Every other file of the release carries the same value. Show it in the page header. |
| `schema_version` | integer | Version of the database schema the export was read from. Informational. |
| `share_import` | object or null | The [domain-share import](#domain-share-import). `null` when no import has share data; then every domain and reach column is `null`. |
| `share_import.import_id` | integer | The import's id. |
| `share_import.status` | string | `completed`, `in_progress` (only when the export was asked to include an unfinished scan) or `pruned` (the scan's detailed data was deleted by housekeeping; its totals were kept). |
| `share_import.source` | string | `live` (computed from the scan's data) or `snapshot` (from the totals kept after pruning). Same numbers either way. |
| `share_import.scanned_domains` | integer | Domains the import scanned: the denominator of every domain percentage. |
| `id_encoding` | string | The [id encoding](#id-encoding) in one sentence, for reference. |
| `files` | object | Every file kind, keyed by kind (table above), in the order written. |
| `files.<kind>.path` | string | The kind's path relative to the release. A list's path is fixed; a card's has `{placeholder}`s. |
| `files.<kind>.report` | string | The report the file kind holds. |
| `files.<kind>.rows` | object | Lists only: row count per table id, e.g. `{"dns_providers": 6}`. |
| `files.<kind>.list` | string | Cards only: the kind of the list whose rows name the cards. |
| `files.<kind>.table` | string | Cards only: the table id within that list whose rows name the cards. |
| `files.<kind>.keys` | object | Cards only: placeholder → the list column holding its id. For `template`, `{"service_provider_id": "provider_id", "service_id": "service_id"}`: the templates list calls the service provider's id `provider_id`. |
| `files.<kind>.files` | integer | Cards only: card files written, one per row of the list table. |

## Id encoding

Ids come from external data (the Templates repository, DNS providers' settings
responses), so each id is encoded into exactly one safe path segment before it is put
into a path template. Numeric ids are encoded from their decimal text.

**Encode:** take the id's UTF-8 bytes. Keep each byte that is `a`-`z`, `0`-`9`, `.`, `_`
or `-`, except a `.` that is the first byte. Replace every other byte, uppercase letters
included, with `~` followed by the byte's value as two lowercase hex digits.

**Decode:** replace each `~xx` with the byte `0xxx`, keep every other character, and read
the bytes as UTF-8.

The result never contains `/`, `%` or uppercase letters, is never `.` or `..` and never
starts with `.`. It is safe on case-insensitive filesystems and needs no further URL
encoding. Domain-like ids stay readable.

| Id | Encoded segment |
|---|---|
| `example.com` | `example.com` |
| `42` | `42` |
| `Example.com` | `~45xample.com` |
| `a/b` | `a~2fb` |
| `100%` | `100~25` |
| `..` | `~2e.` |
| `.hidden` | `~2ehidden` |
| `münchen.de` | `m~c3~bcnchen.de` |
| `UPPER case` | `~55~50~50~45~52~20case` |

For example, the card of template `Mail` of service provider `Acme.example` is
`templates/~41cme.example/~4dail.json`.

Page URLs (see [Cross-links](#cross-links)) carry the **raw** id in a query parameter
(`?id=Acme.example`, URL-encoded by the browser as usual); the page encodes it with the
rule above to build the file path. Only file paths use this encoding.

```js
function encodeSegment(id) {
  const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(String(id));
  let out = "";
  bytes.forEach((b, i) => {
    const keep = (b >= 0x61 && b <= 0x7a) || (b >= 0x30 && b <= 0x39) || b === 0x5f || b === 0x2d
      || (b === 0x2e && i > 0);
    out += keep ? String.fromCharCode(b) : "~" + b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0");
  });
  return out;
}
```

## File shape

Every file except the manifest has the same shape:

```json
{"generated_at": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z",
 "notes": ["Domain share: import 1780272000 (completed, live), 12000 domains scanned. Support columns are current state."],
 "tables": {
  "<table id>": {"title": "...", "columns": [{"key": "...", "header": "..."}], "rows": [{...}], "footer": null}
 }}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `generated_at` | The release's `generated_at` (same as the manifest's). |
| `notes` | Free-text lines to show with the data, in order. In every list and card except `overview.json` the first note names the domain-share import. Show them verbatim, don't parse them; the manifest's `share_import` has the same facts as fields. |
| `tables` | The file's tables, keyed by **table id**, in display order. Find a table by its id, never by position or title. |
| `tables.<id>.title` | Display title. |
| `tables.<id>.columns` | The columns in display order: `key` (the row key) and `header` (a short display label, often upper case). |
| `tables.<id>.rows` | The rows. Each row is an object with exactly the column keys, holding raw values: numbers stay numbers, a count and its percentage are separate keys. |
| `tables.<id>.footer` | A summary row keyed like the rows (e.g. a `TOTAL` row), or `null`. |

Some tables hold one record, not a list: they have exactly one row, and each column is a
field (e.g. a DNS provider's stored data). Read them as `rows[0].<field>`; show them
transposed, one labelled line per field.

Each file is compact JSON with one table row per line, so it can be parsed while it
downloads, but a normal `JSON.parse` of the whole file is fine.

**Ignore what you don't know.** New tables, new columns and new keys may appear without
a format version bump. A frontend must ignore unknown tables, columns and keys, and must
not depend on the order of keys inside a row.

## Values

| Kind of value | Representation |
|---|---|
| Count | Integer ≥ 0. |
| Percentage | Number on a 0–100 scale, **not rounded** (e.g. `33.33333333333333`): round for display. |
| Timestamp | String, UTC, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` (e.g. `2026-03-02 02:00:00`). A few older values may be ISO 8601 with a `T` and a UTC offset; read the first 19 characters. Only `generated_at` uses the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` form. |
| Id | `dns_provider_id`, `import_id`, `sweep_id`: integers. `provider_id`, `service_provider_id`, `service_id`: strings. |
| Versions | Array of integers. |
| `null` | Unknown or not applicable, **never** a stand-in for zero. The column tables below say what `null` means where it can occur. A domain or reach column is `null` when there is no domain-share import (`share_import` is `null`) or the import has no measurement for that entity. A percentage is `null` when its denominator is unknown or 0. |

Text values (names, descriptions, error messages) come from external sources. Escape them
when rendering HTML.

## Domain-share import

Domain and reach columns (`domains`, `domains_pct`, `reach_domains`, `reach_pct`,
`share_pct`, `rank`, ...) describe **one import**, the same for every file of a release:
`manifest.share_import`. By default it is the newest completed import. The person running
the export can pick another one, or include an import that is still running.

Support columns (supported counts, supporting providers, statuses) are always the
**current state** at `generated_at`, not the state at the time of that import. A DNS
provider's support is probed continuously, while scans of the zone are rare and large, so
the two have different clocks. The history tables give the past values of both.

Domains are attributed through the URL in each domain's Domain Connect record: a domain
counts for the DNS provider that currently owns that URL. Each URL has one owner, so no
domain counts twice.

## Files

Each file kind below lists its tables by id, and every column with its type and meaning.
Unless said otherwise, a list contains **every** entity (no limit, no filter) and a card
always contains all of its tables.

### `overview.json` (report `support-overview`)

The data for the "Domain Connect support over time" chart: two series, each on its own
time axis, oldest first. No notes.

#### Table `adoption`

"Adoption per import": one row per import, oldest first. Completed imports and pruned ones
(kept as totals after housekeeping) are included, and an import still running only if the
export was run with `--include-incomplete` (its `status` is then `in_progress`). An import
without data has no row.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `import_id` | integer | The import. |
| `status` | string | `completed`, `pruned` or `in_progress`. |
| `source` | string | `live` or `snapshot` (from the totals kept after pruning). |
| `started_at` | timestamp | When the import started. For imports pruned before the totals kept their dates, inferred from the `import_id` read as Unix seconds; `null` when that is not a plausible date. |
| `completed_at` | timestamp | When the import finished. `null` while running, and for some old pruned imports. |
| `scanned_domains` | count | Domains scanned. |
| `dc_domains` | count | Scanned domains whose Domain Connect URL is attributed to a known DNS provider. `null` when the import has no share data. |
| `dc_pct` | percentage | `dc_domains` / `scanned_domains`. `null` when either is unknown or nothing was scanned. |
| `dc_domains_total` | count | Every scanned domain with a Domain Connect URL, attributed or not (at least `dc_domains`). `null` for old pruned imports that didn't keep it. |
| `dc_total_pct` | percentage | `dc_domains_total` / `scanned_domains`. `null` as above. |
| `dns_providers` | count | DNS providers with at least one attributed domain in the import. `null` without share data. |
| `stacks` | count | Distinct stacks among those DNS providers (by each provider's current stack). `null` without share data. |

#### Table `ecosystem`

"Support ecosystem per full sweep": one row per full support sweep (all DNS providers ×
all templates), oldest first, with the support state once that sweep had run. Support seen
by smaller runs in between counts towards the preceding full sweep. Sweeps before the
first support was ever recorded have no row.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sweep_id` | integer | The sweep. |
| `started_at` | timestamp | When the sweep started. |
| `supporting_dns_providers` | count | DNS providers supporting at least one template. |
| `supporting_stacks` | count | Distinct stacks among them (by each provider's current stack). |
| `supported_templates` | count | Templates supported by at least one DNS provider. |
| `supported_combinations` | count | Distinct (DNS provider, template) pairs with support, versions folded together. |
| `known_dns_providers` | count | DNS providers known at the sweep's start: a denominator for `supporting_dns_providers`. |
| `published_templates` | count | Templates whose first version was published at or before the sweep's start: a denominator for `supported_templates`. |

### `dns-providers.json` (report `dns-providers`)

#### Table `dns_providers`

"DNS providers": every DNS provider, including ones never probed, unreachable ones and
ones with no domains in the domain-share import. Ordered by `domains` descending
(unmeasured last); without a domain-share import, by `supported_count` descending, then
name.

The support columns count **probe combinations**: one per template version the DNS
provider was (or is to be) probed for.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | The DNS provider's name (`providerName` from its settings), else its first Domain Connect URL, else `?`. Not unique: several deployments of one stack often share a name; show `api_host` next to it. |
| `dns_provider_id` | integer | The DNS provider's id: links to its card. |
| `provider_id` | string | Its stack: links to the stack card. `null` when it declares none (no stack). |
| `api_host` | string | Host name of its Domain Connect API. `null` when it declares none. |
| `settings_status` | string | Outcome of the last settings request: `ok`, `http_error` (an unusable HTTP answer), `connection_error` (timeout or connection failure, may heal) or `dead` (given up: unreachable for a long time, or a permanent failure such as an invalid TLS certificate). `null` before the first attempt. |
| `support_status` | string | Outcome of the last support probe: `ok` (a clear supported/not-supported answer), `error` (an unusable HTTP answer) or `dead` (given up, as above). `null` before the first probe. |
| `total` | count | Probe combinations on record (template versions). |
| `supported_count` | count | Combinations whose latest probe said supported. |
| `supported_pct` | percentage | `supported_count` / `total`. `null` when `total` is 0. |
| `unsupported_count` | count | Combinations whose latest probe said not supported. |
| `unsupported_pct` | percentage | `unsupported_count` / `total`. `null` when `total` is 0. |
| `domains` | count | Domains attributed to this DNS provider in the domain-share import. `null` without a domain-share import, or when the provider has no measurement in a pruned import (it was first seen later). |
| `domains_pct` | percentage | `domains` / the import's scanned domains. |

### `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` (report `dns-provider-summary`)

| `support_last_status` | string | As `support_status` in the list. |
| `support_last_error` | string | The last support probe's error message. `null` when it succeeded or none was made. |

| `scanned_domains` | count | The import's scanned domains. |
| `share_pct` | percentage | `domains` / `scanned_domains`. |
| `rank` | integer | 1 = most domains among the import's DNS providers; ties share a rank. `null` at 0 or unmeasured domains. |

### `stacks.json` (report `stacks`)

#### Table `stacks`

"DNS provider stacks": every stack. DNS providers without a stack are not in any row. The
support of a stack is given as a distribution over its deployments (min/median/max),
because it often varies a lot between deployments of the same software. Ordered by

the template's raw (unencoded) ids: `<service_provider_id>/<service_id>/metadata`, and so
on. Find them by that full id, or by the suffix after the last `/`. Each title starts with
`<service_provider_id>/<service_id> - `.

#### Table `{service_provider_id}/{service_id}/metadata`

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `service_provider_name` | string | The service provider's name. `null` if it declares none. |

#### Table `{service_provider_id}/{service_id}/records`

"Records": the DNS records the template applies, one row each, as published in the
Templates repository. **The columns vary per template**: they are the field names the
records use, verbatim as key and header, the common ones first in this order, then any
others alphabetically. A field a record lacks is `null`. No rows when no records are
stored.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | Record type (`A`, `CNAME`, `TXT`, `MX`, `SRV`, `SPFM`, ...). |
| `groupId` | string | Group the record belongs to; groups can be applied separately. |
| `host` | string | Host name, relative to the domain (`@` = the domain itself). May contain `%variables%`. |

| `txtConflictMatchingPrefix` | string | The prefix for `txtConflictMatchingMode` `Prefix`. |

Any other field follows the Domain Connect template specification and is shown as is.
Values are as written in the template file, so a number may also appear as a string, and
`%variables%` may appear in any field.

#### Table `{service_provider_id}/{service_id}/supporters`

"Supporting DNS providers (current state)": every DNS provider currently supporting any
version, one row each. Ordered by `domains` descending; without a domain-share import, by
name. The `footer` is a `TOTAL` row: `name` is `TOTAL`, `domains` and `reach_pct` are the
sums (`null` without a domain-share import), every other key is `null`.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | As in `dns-providers.json`. |

#### Table `{service_provider_id}/{service_id}/history`

"Support history": one row per sweep that re-probed the template on every DNS provider,
oldest first. A sweep limited to recently changed templates is a row only for the
templates it covered.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `sweep_id` | integer | The sweep. |
| `started_at` | timestamp | When it started. |
| `supporting_providers` | count | DNS providers supporting any version once the sweep had run. |
| `change` | integer | Difference to the previous row (the first row's difference to 0). |

## Row order and completeness

- Every list holds **all** rows, with no limit. Its default order (given per table above)
  is by domains or reach in the domain-share import, the most important first. Sort and
  filter on the client as you like; the export's order is a sensible default.
- Every list row has exactly one card, and every card belongs to exactly one list row:
  `files.<kind>.files` equals the list table's row count.
- Every id that appears anywhere in the export (in a list, a card, a footer) resolves to
  an existing card file. The exceptions: a `provider_id` that is `null` (no stack, so no
  stack card), and the `TOTAL` footer row.

## Cross-links

Which key links to which card:

| In file / table | Key(s) | Links to |
|---|---|---|
| `dns-providers.json` `dns_providers` | `dns_provider_id` | `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` |
| `dns-providers.json` `dns_providers` | `provider_id` (when not `null`) | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` |
| `dns-providers/{id}.json` `provider` | `provider_id` (when not `null`) | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` |
| `dns-providers/{id}.json` `supported_templates` | `service_provider_id` | `service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json` |
| `dns-providers/{id}.json` `supported_templates` | `service_provider_id` + `service_id` | `templates/{service_provider_id}/{service_id}.json` |
| `stacks.json` `stacks` | `provider_id` | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` |
| `stacks/{id}.json` `deployments` | `dns_provider_id` | `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` |
| `stacks/{id}.json` `template_coverage` | `service_provider_id` (+ `service_id`) | the service provider card (template card) |
| `service-providers.json` `service_providers` | `service_provider_id` | `service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json` |
| `service-providers/{id}.json` `templates`, `support_history` | the card's `service_provider_id` + `service_id` | `templates/{service_provider_id}/{service_id}.json` |
| `templates.json` `service_templates` | `provider_id` (the service provider) | `service-providers/{provider_id}.json` |
| `templates.json` `service_templates` | `provider_id` + `service_id` | `templates/{provider_id}/{service_id}.json` |
| template card `metadata` | `service_provider_id` | `service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json` |
| template card `supporters` | `dns_provider_id` | `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` |
| template card `supporters` | `provider_id` (when not `null`) | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` |

Reverse links that are a filter of a list rather than a key: a stack's deployments are the
`dns-providers.json` rows with its `provider_id` (also in its card's `deployments`), and a
service provider's templates are the `templates.json` rows whose `provider_id` is its id
(also in its card's `templates`).

### Pages

The intended frontend has one HTML page per view. Query parameters carry the **raw** ids
(not the encoded file segment) and filters, so every view is a plain, shareable link:

| Page | Data file |
|---|---|
| `index.html` (overview, the landing page) | `overview.json` |
| `dns-providers.html` (optional `?stack=<provider_id>`, `&q=<search>`) | `dns-providers.json` |
| `stacks.html` | `stacks.json` |
| `service-providers.html` | `service-providers.json` |
| `templates.html` (optional `?spid=<service_provider_id>`) | `templates.json` |
| `dns-provider.html?id=<dns_provider_id>` | `dns-providers/{dns_provider_id}.json` |
| `stack.html?id=<provider_id>` | `stacks/{provider_id}.json` |
| `service-provider.html?id=<service_provider_id>` | `service-providers/{service_provider_id}.json` |
| `template.html?spid=<service_provider_id>&sid=<service_id>` | `templates/{service_provider_id}/{service_id}.json` |

A card page with a missing parameter, or whose file is not found (404), shows a "not
found" state that links back to its list page. Every page shows the manifest's
`generated_at` and domain-share import in its header.

## Time series

| Series | File / table | Time axis | One point |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adoption | `overview.json` `adoption` | import | DC domains among the scanned domains of one import |
| Ecosystem support | `overview.json` `ecosystem` | full sweep | Support counts once one full sweep had run |
| DNS provider support | DNS provider card `support_history` | sweep re-probing all its templates | Templates it supported |
| DNS provider share | DNS provider card `share_history` | import | Its domains and share |
| Stack share | stack card `share_history` | import | The stack's summed domains, share and rank |
| Template support | template card `history` | sweep covering the template | DNS providers supporting it |
| Service provider support | service provider card `support_history` | sweep covering each template | DNS providers supporting each template (one line per `service_id`) |

- **Two clocks.** Import-based series are per import, sweep-based ones per sweep. To plot
  both on one date axis, place a sweep at its `started_at`, and an import at its
  `started_at` from `overview.json` `adoption` (look it up by `import_id`; if it is
  missing or `null`, use `completed_at`, and as a last resort `import_id` read as Unix
  seconds).
- **Gaps are not zeros.** A missing row means "not measured then", never 0: no row
  exists before the first event of a series, for sweeps that didn't cover the entity, or
  for an import without data. A `null` value inside a row is likewise unknown. Don't
  interpolate zeros; draw a gap or connect the measured points.
- Each history row is the state **once that sweep had run**, replayed from the recorded
  changes of support, so values only change at sweeps.
- Import series include pruned imports from their kept totals (`source: snapshot`), so they
  reach back further than the detailed data.

## Redaction

The data is public. The export deliberately leaves out pipeline internals, so don't look
for them:

- the raw settings response a DNS provider returned (its useful fields are the `provider`
  table's columns);
- how far probing has got: the counts of probes still pending, being retried or failed
  (hence `total - supported_count - unsupported_count` is "not yet determined");
- internal keys and scheduling data: row identity keys, rate-limiting keys and the
  timestamps of the last check attempts.

Error messages (`settings_last_error`, `support_last_error`) and the last successful
contact (`*_last_seen_ok_at`) **are** included.

## Versioning and compatibility

- `format_version` (now `1`) changes only on a **breaking** change: a removed or renamed
  file kind, table id or column key; a changed type or meaning of a value; a changed path
  template or id encoding.
- **Additive** changes keep the version: new file kinds, tables, columns, manifest keys or
  notes, and new values of a status enumeration. A frontend must ignore what it doesn't
  know (see [File shape](#file-shape)).
- Titles, headers and note texts are display text, not part of the contract; they may
  change at any time.
- Card URLs are stable as long as the ids are. A `dns_provider_id` is a database id that
  is never reused (the scanner's database is upgraded in place, never rebuilt); its card
  disappears only when two DNS providers turn out to be one and are merged, keeping one
  id. Service provider and template ids come from the Templates repository and change
  only when a template is renamed or removed there. Stack ids are the providers' own
  `providerId`s.

## Caveats

Limits of the data a page should footnote or surface:

- **Attributed domains only.** `domains`, `dc_domains` and reach count only domains whose
  Domain Connect URL is attributed to a known DNS provider. Domains whose provider could
  never be identified are in `dc_domains_total` only.
- **Sampled scans.** An import may scan only a random sample of a zone. Percentages are of
  the scanned domains, an estimate for the zone, not a census.
- **One zone set.** The numbers describe the zones that were scanned (e.g. `.com`,
  `.net`, `.org`), not the whole Internet.
- **Older imports have less history.** Share histories start with the first import whose
  per-provider share was recorded; very old imports may lack `completed_at`,
  `dc_domains_total` or even `started_at`.
- **History vs. current state.** The history tables replay the recorded *changes* of
  support. A DNS provider whose latest probe failed keeps the support it last had there,
  while current-state tables count only clear answers of the latest probe. The latest
  history point can therefore exceed the current count (e.g. a template's last `history`
  row vs. its `supporters` rows).
- **Current stacks.** Stack attribution (`stacks`, `supporting_stacks`, stack share
  histories) uses each DNS provider's **current** stack, also for past imports and sweeps.
- **Old sweep classification.** Sweeps limited to recently changed templates recorded
  before that limit was stored count as full sweeps.
- **`total` of a DNS provider without combinations is 1**, not 0 (a known defect);
  its `supported_count` and `unsupported_count` are 0.
- **Statuses lag.** `settings_status`/`support_status` describe the last attempt, which
  may be days old for a DNS provider that is rarely re-checked.
