# Measuring Domain Connect support: methodology

This document describes how the published Domain Connect support statistics are obtained:
which domains are examined, how the DNS providers behind them are identified, how support
for each template is established, and which limits apply to the resulting figures. It is
intended for DNS providers, service providers, journalists and other readers of the
statistics, and assumes no knowledge of the measuring software or of the format in which
the statistics are distributed. The terms used are defined in Section 1.1 and carry that
meaning throughout.

## 1. Overview

The measurement consists of two independent processes with different cadences.

1. **Domain scan.** The domains of one or more top-level domain (TLD) zones are examined
   for a Domain Connect record. The result is, per scan, the number of domains examined and
   the number of those domains that refer to each Domain Connect endpoint. The domain scan
   determines how many domains a DNS provider serves.
2. **Support probing.** Every DNS provider identified from those endpoints is asked, for
   every published Domain Connect template, whether it supports the template. Support
   probing determines what a DNS provider supports.

The published statistics combine both: the domain counts of one selected scan (the
*reference scan*) with the support state at the time of publication.

### 1.1 Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Domain Connect | An open protocol that lets a service (for example, a website builder or an e-mail host) configure the DNS records of a customer's domain at the customer's DNS provider by applying a *template*. A domain advertises support through a TXT record that holds the address of its DNS provider's Domain Connect endpoint (Section 3). |
| Service provider | A publisher of templates in the public Domain Connect Templates repository (Section 5.1), identified by a domain-like identifier. |
| Template | One service of a service provider: a set of DNS records that a DNS provider applies on request. Identified by the service provider's identifier together with a service identifier. |
| Template version | A numbered revision of a template. |
| DNS provider | One deployment of Domain Connect: an endpoint that answered the protocol's settings request (Section 4.2). Two companies running the same software are two DNS providers. |
| Stack | All DNS providers that declare the same provider identifier, that is, deployments of the same software or company (Section 4.2). |
| Scan | One examination of the domains of one or more zone files (Section 2), dated by its start. |
| Scanned domains | The domains a scan actually examined; the denominator of every published percentage of domains. |
| Domain Connect domain | A scanned domain that publishes a valid Domain Connect record (Section 3). |
| Attributed domain | A Domain Connect domain whose record leads to an identified DNS provider (Section 4.3). |
| Reference scan | The scan whose domain counts the published statistics use: by default the most recent completed scan. |
| Reach | For a template: the attributed domains of the reference scan whose DNS providers support the template, each DNS provider counted once. It is the number of scanned domains that could apply the template at the time of publication. |
| Support probe | One query asking a DNS provider whether it supports a template (Section 5.2). |
| Sweep, run | A batch of support probes over a defined set of DNS providers and template versions; a *full sweep* covers all of them (Section 5.3). |
| Current state | The outcome of the most recent conclusive probe of each combination of DNS provider and template version (Section 5.2). |
| History | The recorded changes of support over time, from which past numbers of supported templates and supporting DNS providers are reconstructed (Section 5.2). |

## 2. Population and sampling

### 2.1 Zone files

The population consists of the domains delegated in the zone files of generic top-level
domains, obtained from ICANN's Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS). A domain is counted
when the zone file contains a name-server (NS) delegation for it; every delegated name is
counted once, irrespective of the number of its name-server records. Names below the
delegated domains (subdomains) are not part of the population, because zone files do not
list them.

At the time of writing, the scanned zones are `.com`, `.net` and `.org`. The zones of each
scan are recorded and published with that scan, together with the number of domains the zone
files contained and the sampling percentage (Section 2.2). Scans performed before this
information was recorded are published without it.

### 2.2 Census and probability sample

A scan is either a **census**, in which every domain of the selected zones is examined, or
a **probability sample**. In a sample, each domain is included independently with the same
fixed probability π (Bernoulli sampling); the published *sampling percentage* is 100·π, and
100 denotes a census. The number of sampled domains is therefore itself random, with
expectation π·N for a zone of N domains. Inclusion does not depend on the domain's name,
age, registrar or DNS provider.

For a characteristic present in a fraction p of a zone's domains (for example, a Domain
Connect record pointing to one particular DNS provider), the fraction p̂ = x / n observed
among the n scanned domains is an unbiased estimator of p (given n, the sample is a simple
random sample of the zone). Its standard error is approximately

    SE(p̂) ≈ √( (1 − π) · p̂ (1 − p̂) / n ),

where the factor (1 − π) is the finite-population correction; it is negligible for small
sampling percentages and makes the error vanish for a census.

A DNS provider with K domains in the zone is absent from the sample with probability
(1 − π)^K. The sampling percentage required to detect such a provider, that is, to include
at least one of its domains, with probability P is therefore

    π ≥ 1 − (1 − P)^(1/K).

As an illustration, detecting a DNS provider with K = 50 domains in the zone with
probability P = 99.5 % requires π ≥ 1 − 0.005^(1/50) ≈ 0.1005, a sampling percentage of
about 10.1 %. Applied to a zone of 23.7 million domains, such a sample contains about
2.39 million domains. The same sample estimates the share of a DNS provider serving 5 % of
the zone with a standard error of about 0.013 percentage points (95 % confidence interval
approximately ±0.026 percentage points). For the provider with 50 domains, however, the
sample contains on average only about 5 of its domains, and the estimate of its domain
count has a relative standard error of about 42 %, given by √((1 − π) / (π·K)). Small
DNS providers are thus detected reliably at this sampling percentage, but their domain
counts are imprecise. Detection in the sample does not by itself imply that the provider
is examined further; Section 4.4 states the threshold that applies.

Every percentage of domains in the published statistics is a percentage of the **scanned**
domains of the respective scan, that is, of the domains actually examined. For a sample,
it is an estimate of the corresponding percentage of the zone; for a census, it is the zone
value itself. Published domain *counts* of a sampled scan are counts within the sample; an
estimate of the corresponding count in the zone is obtained by dividing by π.

### 2.3 Order of examination

The domains of a scan are examined in a randomised order. A scan that is still in
progress therefore approximates a random sample of its zones. Such a scan is nonetheless
reported as incomplete and is only published when explicitly requested; by default, the
statistics are based on the most recent completed scan.

### 2.4 Frequency

The zone files are downloaded and scanned once per month. A scan of all three zones takes
several days.

## 3. Discovery of Domain Connect records

A domain advertises Domain Connect by publishing a TXT record at the name
`_domainconnect.<domain>`, whose value is the host name and path of its DNS provider's
Domain Connect endpoint. For each scanned domain, this TXT record is queried through public
recursive resolvers using DNS over HTTPS. Queries are distributed over several independent
public resolvers; a query that times out or fails transiently is repeated up to four times.

Each scanned domain is assigned exactly one outcome:

- **Domain Connect URL**: the record exists and its value, prefixed with `https://`, is a
  valid HTTPS URL without query or fragment. The domain counts as a Domain Connect domain
  and is associated with that URL.
- **No record**: the name does not exist or carries no TXT record.
- **Invalid record**: a TXT record exists but does not form a valid URL.
- **Resolution failure**: the resolvers reported a server failure or the query could not
  be completed after the repetitions.

All four outcomes count as scanned. Domains whose resolution failed are thus part of the
denominator although their Domain Connect status is unknown. Most such failures are server
failures, which typically indicate a broken delegation of the domain itself; in recent scans
they concerned of the order of 6 % of the scanned domains. The published percentages are
therefore shares of all delegated domains; shares of the resolvable domains alone would be
higher by approximately the same relative amount.

## 4. Identification of DNS providers

### 4.1 Settings request

A Domain Connect URL is the address of an endpoint, not the identity of a DNS provider.
To identify the provider, the endpoint's *settings* resource is requested, as defined by
the Domain Connect specification, on behalf of one of the domains that referred to the URL
in a scan. A successful answer names the DNS provider (`providerName`), optionally the
provider software or company (`providerId`), and the base address of its template API
(`urlAPI`). An answer that lacks a valid `urlAPI` is treated as unsuccessful, because
support cannot be probed without it. If the request fails for one domain, it is repeated on
behalf of other domains that referred to the same URL before the attempt counts as failed.

### 4.2 Deployments, providers and stacks

A *DNS provider* is one deployment of Domain Connect: the endpoint identified by its
`urlAPI`, or, when the provider declares none, by the Domain Connect URL itself. Several
Domain Connect URLs often lead to the same deployment (for example, redirects or several
nodes behind one API); they are then counted as one DNS provider. Conversely, two
companies running the same software are two DNS providers. A DNS provider is recorded only
after at least one successful settings answer.

DNS providers that declare the same `providerId` form a *stack*, for example all
deployments of one hosting control panel. A DNS provider that declares no `providerId`
belongs to no stack. Stack membership is taken from each DNS provider's most recent
answer.

### 4.3 Attribution of domains

Each Domain Connect URL is attributed to exactly one DNS provider: the one that most
recently answered the settings request for it. A domain is attributed to the DNS provider
of its URL. Because every URL has a single owner, no domain is counted for two DNS
providers, and the domain counts of all DNS providers may be added. A domain whose URL
could not be attributed (Section 4.4) counts as a Domain Connect domain but not towards any
DNS provider.

### 4.4 Minimum size

Settings requests and support probes are restricted to Domain Connect URLs that were
referred to by at least a minimum number of scanned domains, summed over the scans still
retained. At the time of writing, this minimum is 50 domains. The restriction concentrates
the measurement on endpoints that serve a meaningful number of domains; most of the excluded
URLs are individual installations of hosting software that serve a single domain. As a
consequence, support by DNS providers below the threshold is not observed.

The threshold applies to scanned domains, not to domains in the zone. In a sampled scan
with sampling percentage 100·π, it therefore corresponds to approximately 50 / π domains
in the zone for an endpoint seen in that scan alone; at the 10.1 % of the example in
Section 2.2, to about 500 domains. An endpoint that is detected in the sample but referred
to by fewer scanned domains than the threshold is counted as a Domain Connect domain, but
its DNS provider is not identified.

### 4.5 Frequency

The settings of all DNS providers above the threshold are requested again once per month,
about one week after the monthly domain scan has begun, so that DNS providers first seen in
that scan are identified and changes of name, software or API address are detected.

## 5. Determination of template support

### 5.1 Templates

The set of templates is the public [Domain Connect Templates
repository](https://github.com/Domain-Connect/Templates), synchronised daily. Each template
version is recorded with the date on which it was first published in the repository.

### 5.2 Support probe

For each combination of a DNS provider and a template version, the DNS provider's template
API is queried for the template, identified by its service provider and service
identifiers, as defined by the Domain Connect specification. The answer is classified as
follows:

- **Supported**: HTTP status 200.
- **Not supported**: HTTP status 404.
- **Not yet determined**: any other answer, a failed connection, or no probe yet.

The query names the template, not a version of it; the published statistics accordingly
treat a template as supported by a DNS provider when any of its versions is.

The *current state* of a combination is the classification of its most recent conclusive
probe, that is, the most recent probe that yielded *supported* or *not supported*. In
addition, every change between *supported* and *not supported* is recorded with the time at
which it was observed. These records form the published history. A change is observed at
the time of the first probe after it occurred, so the temporal resolution of the history
equals the probing interval of the respective combination (Section 5.3).

### 5.3 Probing runs

Probes are organised in runs, each covering a defined set of combinations:

| Run | Combinations | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Full sweep | Every DNS provider × every template version | Monthly, after the settings of all DNS providers have been requested again |
| Recent templates | Every DNS provider × template versions first published in the preceding 14 days | Daily |
| Single DNS provider | One DNS provider × every template version | On demand, for example after a provider reports a change |
| Single template or service provider | Every DNS provider × the versions of one template, or of all templates of one service provider | On demand |

A full sweep re-examines every combination, including those already known to be
supported, so that withdrawn support is detected. The daily run of recent templates
observes the adoption of a new template during its first two weeks at daily resolution.
Published histories count only runs that covered the subject of the history completely:
a DNS provider's history counts full sweeps and runs for that DNS provider alone; a
template's history counts every run that probed the template on all DNS providers,
including the daily run of recent templates while the template is covered by it; and
ecosystem-wide series count full sweeps only, a smaller run counting towards the preceding
full sweep.

### 5.4 Number of supported templates and its change

The number of templates a DNS provider supports counts each template once, irrespective of
the number of its supported versions. For a stack, it is the number of templates supported
by at least one of its DNS providers.

The change of this number is derived from the recorded history (Section 5.2), not from
repeated current-state counts. The history is replayed up to the start of each run, and
the number of supported templates after a run is compared with the number after an
earlier run. Two intervals are published:

- **Latest run:** the difference between the most recent run and the preceding one. For a
  DNS provider, these are the runs that covered all of its templates (full sweeps and runs
  for that DNS provider alone); for a stack, full sweeps only, since only these cover all
  of its DNS providers at once.
- **About 90 days:** the difference between the most recent run and the newest run that
  started at least 90 days before it.

No change is stated when the earlier run started before the DNS provider (for a stack: its
first DNS provider) was first identified, because no measured starting point exists; an
increase from such an unmeasured baseline would otherwise be indistinguishable from
adoption. Because the change is computed from the history, it is subject to the
difference between history and current state described in Section 8.

## 6. Status of DNS providers and handling of failures

### 6.1 Status values

The outcome of the most recent settings request and of the most recent support probe of
each DNS provider is published as a status, together with the error message of the last
failure and the time of the last successful contact.

| Status | Request | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | settings, support | The endpoint answered conclusively: a usable settings answer, or a support answer of *supported* or *not supported*. |
| `http_error` | settings | The endpoint answered, but the answer was unusable: an HTTP status other than 200, a body that is not valid JSON, or a missing or invalid `urlAPI`. |
| `error` | support | The endpoint answered with an HTTP status other than 200 or 404, or no answer was obtained (connection failure). |
| `connection_error` | settings | No answer was obtained: time-out, refused or reset connection, or a protocol error. Such failures are presumed transient. |
| `dead` | settings, support | The endpoint is considered unreachable for the current run (Section 6.3). |

### 6.2 Repetition after failures

Two kinds of failure are distinguished, and they are repeated differently.

- **Unusable answers** (an HTTP status or body that cannot be interpreted) concern a
  single request. The request is repeated up to five times (settings, after the
  alternative domains of Section 4.1 are exhausted) or six times (support), with the
  waiting time doubling from 5 seconds (5 s, 10 s, 20 s, ...), in total for a few minutes.
  If every repetition fails, the result remains undetermined until the next run that
  covers it.
- **Connection failures** concern the endpoint as a whole. After such a failure, no request
  of any kind is sent to the endpoint for a pause that starts at 30 seconds and doubles with
  every consecutive failure, up to 24 hours. Any answer from the endpoint, even an error
  status, ends the series of failures and the pause.

### 6.3 Abandonment

An endpoint is marked `dead`, and its outstanding requests in the current run are
abandoned, in two cases:

- its consecutive connection failures have extended the pause to the 24-hour maximum,
  which occurs after 13 consecutive failures spread over roughly a day and a half; or
- a single failure is permanent by nature, namely an invalid TLS certificate (expired,
  self-signed or issued for another name) or an API address that cannot be requested at
  all.

The status `dead` is not final. The next run that covers the DNS provider contacts it
again, and a conclusive answer restores the status `ok`. Support recorded before an
endpoint became unreachable is retained in the history but not counted in the current
state, which counts only conclusive answers.

## 7. Load on DNS providers' endpoints

The measurement limits the rate of requests to every endpoint. An endpoint is identified by
its host name, port and the leading segments of its path, so that independent
installations sharing one host name are treated separately. Each measuring process leaves
at least 0.5 seconds between two requests to the same endpoint; with the two processes
operated per request type, an endpoint receives at most about four requests per second, and
pending requests are interleaved across endpoints, so that the rate typically remains well
below this bound. Connection failures pause all requests to the endpoint (Section 6.2).

In absolute terms, a full sweep sends each DNS provider one request per template version,
of the order of 1,400 requests per month at the time of writing, spread over at least
several minutes. The daily run of recent templates sends each DNS provider one request per
template version published in the preceding 14 days, typically a few requests per day. One
settings request per Domain Connect URL is sent per month, apart from the repetitions
described in Section 6.2. The domain scan itself contacts only public DNS resolvers, not
the DNS providers.

## 8. Limitations

- **Zones only.** The statistics describe the scanned zones (Section 2.1), not the whole
  domain name system. Country-code top-level domains, whose zone files are generally not
  available, and subdomains are not covered.
- **Sampling error.** Figures of a sampled scan are estimates (Section 2.2). Differences
  between two scans smaller than about twice the standard error are not meaningful.
- **Attributed domains only.** Domain counts of DNS providers and stacks, and the reach of
  templates, include only domains whose Domain Connect URL is attributed to an identified
  DNS provider (Section 4.3). Domains referring to endpoints below the minimum size
  (Section 4.4) or to endpoints that never answered the settings request are counted only
  in the total of Domain Connect domains.
- **Advertised, not exercised, support.** A positive probe establishes that the DNS
  provider's API acknowledges the template. Whether applying the template succeeds for a
  particular domain or account is not tested.
- **History versus current state.** Domain counts refer to the reference scan, which
  may be several weeks old, whereas support refers to the time of publication. The history
  replays observed changes; a DNS provider whose latest probes failed keeps its last
  observed support in the history, while the current state counts only conclusive answers.
  The latest point of a history, and a change derived from it (Section 5.4), may therefore
  disagree with the corresponding current value.
- **Temporal resolution.** Changes of support are dated by the probe that observed them,
  that is, to within one month for established templates and within one day for templates
  in their first 14 days.
- **Current stacks.** Stack membership is the current one, also when applied to past
  scans and sweeps (Section 4.2).
- **Status lag.** The status of a DNS provider describes its most recent contact, which for
  a rarely examined provider may be several weeks old.
