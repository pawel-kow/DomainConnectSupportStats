# Testing

Test layers, conventions and gates.

Related: [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) §3.2 (when tests are written),
[contract/export/EXPORT_FORMAT.md](contract/export/EXPORT_FORMAT.md) (what the tests hold the site to).

Tests pin the contract's rules and the meaning of what is shown, not the markup.

## 1. Principles

### 1.1 Injection, no module mocking

Collaborators are arguments:

| Seam                | Injected as                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP**            | `new ExportClient(baseUrl, fetchFn)`, `new RegistryClient(baseUrl, fetchFn)`; tests serve the examples from disk (`tests/unit/load.test.ts`, `registry-load.test.ts`) |
| **Configuration**   | `resolveDataBaseUrl(runtime, buildTime, pageUrl)`; only `dataBaseUrl()` reads `window`                                                                                |
| **Filesystem**      | `validateRelease(dir, ajv)`, `validateRegistry(dir)`; tests pass corrupted temp copies                                                                                |
| **Browser network** | Playwright `page.route()` (e.g. a failing manifest)                                                                                                                   |

No `vi.mock`, `vi.spyOn` on module exports or `vi.stubGlobal` for these; add a parameter.

### 1.2 Behaviour, not structure

Assert on return values and on what the page shows (text, roles, links). Query by role, label,
text and `data-testid`; never by CSS class or by which helper was called.

### 1.3 The example export is the fixture

Fixtures come from `contract/export/examples/export/` (`tests/fixtures.ts`) and
`contract/registry/examples/`, never from the `registry/` submodule.
Variants copy an example file and change the one field under test.

### 1.4 Real data before review

Page changes are run against the current real release before review (DEVELOPING.md §3.6).

| Component | `tests/component/` | Vitest (jsdom, `// @vitest-environment jsdom`) | Svelte component, example data                | nothing                             |

## 3. Unit tests (`tests/unit/`)

| File                     | Pins                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `derive.test.ts`         | `leaderboards.json` from the example export: `generated_at`, first sweep, first support per DNS provider newest first, first sweep left out, another release fails                     |
| `leaderboards.test.ts`   | One row per DNS provider, domains when supporting, top 10 by a positive value, ties by domains then name, windows, reach boards, new supporters (30 days, scanner start), display rows |

| `links.test.ts`          | Page URLs carry raw ids; `safeUrl` accepts only http(s), `safeMailto` only plain addresses                                                                                             |

| `changelog.test.ts`      | CHANGELOG section lookup by version, version check (missing section, invalid SemVer)                                                                                                   |

## 4. Contract tests (`tests/contract/`)

`example-export.test.ts`:

- The example export is a valid release under `validateRelease` (schemas, one `generated_at`,
  manifest counts, every list row's card present).
- Its `format_version` is `SUPPORTED_FORMAT_VERSION`; every report the manifest names has a
  vendored schema.
- `validateRelease` catches a missing card, a file from another release, a schema violation, a
  wrong manifest count.
- Every file has the generic shape the pages read; every row has exactly its columns' keys.

`example-registry.test.ts`:

- The golden registry copy is valid under `validateRegistry` (schema, entry path, logo).
- The schema: `providerId` and `name` required, unknown keys allowed, tri-state flags, onboarding
  modes, contacts, http(s) URLs, logo file names.
- `validateRegistry` catches a missing `providers/` folder, an entry at the wrong path, a missing
  logo, a schema violation, invalid JSON.
- `bundleRegistry` publishes entries and logos at `<a>/<b>/<encoded name>` with `registry.json`,
  replacing an earlier bundle.

## 5. Component tests (`tests/component/`)

| File                | Pins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DataTable.test.ts` | Headers from the file's columns, export order by default, number/percent formatting, sort cycle (numbers descending first, nulls last, back to export order), filter with row count, empty state, footer row, third-party text escaped, internal id columns never shown, phone-only columns, pagination (pages, size, reset, no pager for one page) |
| `Layout.test.ts`    | Annotation after the page body: `generated_at`, domain-share import by its completion time and scanned domains (or that there is none), the default or passed sweep, `–` when unknown, no methodology link on the methodology page, current page marked in the navigation, footer shows the site version and the registry commit (or none)          |
| `Registry.test.ts`  | Card title with logo; contact block and registry details: links only through `safeUrl`/`safeMailto`, unknown rows left out, empty blocks not shown, the stack named for several deployments, HTML in notes as text                                                                                                                                  |

`@testing-library/svelte`; `tests/setup.ts` registers jest-dom matchers and cleanup.

## 6. End-to-end tests (`tests/e2e/`)

Playwright builds the site and serves it with `vite preview`, with the release under `/data/`
(`DATA_DIR`, default: the example export), its derived data (`npm run derive` into `.derived-e2e/`, apart from the dev server's
`.derived/`) under `/data/derived/` and the registry under `/registry/` (`REGISTRY_DIR`, default:
`contract/registry/examples`). Projects: `desktop` (Desktop Chrome), `mobile`
(Pixel 7). The `consoleErrors` fixture fails a test on any page or console error unless it sets
`expectErrors`.

| File                        | Pins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `navigation.spec.ts`        | Every page renders the header and the navigation; the data annotation at the end of every page, methodology without its own link, `–` sweep on a card not found; navigation links are plain page links                                                                                                                                      |
| `overview.spec.ts`          | Headline numbers, chart drawn without data tables, no internal id, most improved top 5 and leaderboards link, new supporters (empty and listed), "not available" in place of a panel whose data failed, no horizontal page scroll, error state when the data is unavailable                                                                 |
| `leaderboards.spec.ts`      | Boards by templates, domains and most improved per DNS provider (deployments apart, name and API host), `?window=` switch in place (no reload, scroll kept, URL follows), unmeasured window, reach boards, new supporters (empty and listed), "not available" in place of a panel whose data failed, no horizontal page scroll              |
| `dns-providers.spec.ts`     | Visible rows, combined cells, caveats; badges with raw hover text; show-all toggle in the URL; stack filter and its way back; empty stack; `?q=` pre-fill and URL sync; sort; phone columns; pages of a 1,000-row list (size, reset on search); card and stack links; no stack link without a stack; error state; no horizontal page scroll |
| `service-providers.spec.ts` | Every service provider in export order; id below the name, once for an unnamed one; wide-only columns; card and templates-list links; search in the URL; empty state; reach sort; unknown reach as `–`; load error; phone columns, no horizontal scroll                                                                                     |
| `template.spec.ts`          | Template, service provider link and reach; logo from `logo_url`, hidden when broken; supporter links and total; records verbatim without unknown fields, own columns on wide screens only; chart and caveat; sparse template; card order; not-found for missing params and unknown template; phone columns, no horizontal scroll            |
| `dns-provider.spec.ts`      | Provider, stack link and support; template links; both charts without data tables; card order; registry logo, contact and details, sparse entries, no entry, entry 404 and failure, missing `registry.json`; unranked as unknown; not-found for missing, blank, malformed and unknown ids; no horizontal page scroll                        |

Each built page has its own spec: content from the example, links resolving to rendering pages,
not-found state (missing parameter, unknown id), filters and sort.

Against a real release: `DATA_DIR=<release> REGISTRY_DIR=<registry> npm run test:e2e`.

A fresh container needs `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` (the devcontainer's
postCreate runs it).

## 8. Tooling

- Vitest (`test` block in `vite.config.ts`), jsdom, `@testing-library/svelte`,
  `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- Ajv (Draft 2020-12), shared by tests and `scripts/`.
- Playwright (`playwright.config.ts`); reports in `playwright-report/`, uploaded by CI on failure.
